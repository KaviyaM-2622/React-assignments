// Redux is like a single brain for your app.

// It stores all the important information (state) in one place.

// Whenever something changes, you tell Redux what happened (an action).

// Redux updates the information in a predictable way (using reducers).

// Any part of your app can look at this central brain to get the info it needs.

// It helps keep your app organized and predictable, especially when it gets big.
